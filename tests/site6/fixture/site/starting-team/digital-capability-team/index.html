<li>focusing on meeting user needs</li>
<li>collaborating closely with people from other disciplines</li>

They should all have some experience working as a multidisciplinary team and be open to collaborating.</p>
<p>You should encourage people with more experience to mentor those who are new to this way of working. This is a good way to help people who haven't had the chance to increase their skills because they can't progress beyond a certain career point in a government role.</p>
<p>Give people with skills and expertise in their role the chance to work in a multidisciplinary team and they will often flourish.</p>
<p>There may be other people in your organisation who are not as experienced but who are keen to learn and work in a multidisciplinary team. Be open to pairing people who have less experience with experienced people from inside and outside of government.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s possible to use secondments to temporarily transfer people from other parts of government to fill gaps in the team.</p>
<h3 class="display-2">Communicate the value early</h3>
<p>It can be hard to get support for working in a new way in government. The best way to help people is to show the value to them.</p>
<p>You need everyone to support the process to go forward. Make sure you start talking to people as early as you can.</p>
<p>Tell people how the process will add value to how they work. These Guides and case studies can help show how other parts of government are already working in this way.</p>
<h3 class="display-2">Help team members work differently</h3>
<p>The service design and delivery process is a big change in how people work in government. It can be helpful to introduce the concepts to a team in somewhere away from the usual workplace.</p>
<p>Talk to people about how the process can help them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>experiment more</li>
<li>have more decision-making influence</li>
<li>be able increase their skills in new ways</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you listen and respond to all problems. Be honest about the roles and capability you need in the team, how you will measure this and what training is available.</p>
<p>The Guides show what is needed to do the different activities the team does when the follow the process.</p>
<p>You might need to plan some time for people to transition to the new way of working. But it’s important that the team steps away from business as usual work to focus completely on working on the service. Make sure you communicate when this transition period ends and the Discovery stage starts.</p>
