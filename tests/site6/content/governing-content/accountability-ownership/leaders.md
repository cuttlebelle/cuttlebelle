### [2]Senior content leads and/or content strategists

Content leadership raises the profile of quality content with senior executives and teams. Content leaders are points of escalation. They are empowered to say ‘no’ to content that is not user focused.

As enablers and leaders they set direction, and influence and mentor content creators. They take part in digital governance or web steering meetings and report on measures of success.

Accountability and ownership:
- establish overall ownership of a website, the content and the strategy
- set quality content standards, training, tools and templates
- champion the user experience
- champion content planning and workflow
- oversee content and information architecture
- educate content requesters, providers and reviewers/approvers
- create communities of best practice
- be responsible for a maintenance plan

### [2]Measures of success

- reduced number of unused, outdated pages
- visitor activity and user satisfaction
- usability and task completion
- plain English and accessibility (use of guides, standards and WCAG 2.0)
- consistency in visual identity and messaging
