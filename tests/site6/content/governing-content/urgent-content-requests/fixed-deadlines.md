If the deadline is fixed, the content may be already signed off. When you must publish content immediately, you will often need to prioritise business needs over user needs.

However, at a minimum, there are some fast and easy checks you can do so your content can be in a good state when published.  

### [2]Minimal quality checks
- check if [ministerial content](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-guides/common-website-elements/ministerial-content/) is appropriate for publishing on an agency-funded website
- see if other conflicting messages are being published on the same day
- check that images are cleared for publishing and the links work and are meaningful
- check content is written in the right content type template and includes an abstract
- check for [accessibility](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/accessibility-inclusivity/). For example, link text, heading styles, table structure, image alt text, video captions and transcripts
- check any files are accessible. There should be 2 formats, a short overview for html, and contact details

### [2]Post-publishing issues register
Use an issues register to capture urgently published content that does not meet quality standards. Record the content owner and the agreed date to resolve the issue. You can then report to management when issues are resolved. Your report may include improved readability ratings (plain English) or reduced inaccessible attachments.

When you keep an issues register you also raise the profile of user-focused content. It encourages requesters to plan where possible, or consult with you earlier to know what they need to do. Let the nominated owner know that the issues register may also be the subject of a freedom of information (FOI) request.

#### [1]Accessibility issues
Give requesters options:
- Don’t publish if inaccessible. Send them a short guide to getting accessibility right.
- Nominate someone to assume the risk of complaints to the Human Rights Commissioner and record in the register.

#### [1]Bureaucratic language issues
- Nominate a content owner to simplify language. Agree on a timeline that is based on the content's lifespan. Record in the register.
- If needed, set up a meeting with them to discuss an approach to plain English. Provide them with guidelines.
