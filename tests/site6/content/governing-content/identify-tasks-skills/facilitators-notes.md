### [2]Preparation

- Allocate 2 hours for your activity
- Invite people from your immediate team or from across your agency. Involve those who request, plan, write, check and review, produce and publish content
- Write 2 sets of content lifecycle stage headings across a wall. Break participants into 2 groups of 3 to 4 people
- You will need to assign:
    - a facilitator to each lifecycle stage group
    - a timekeeper for the exercises
    - a note taker during share back to capture participants’ subtext. The notes will be useful in defining your next steps.
- Have a supply of sharpies and post-it notes in 3 different light colours (for roles, tasks and skills). Use red dots at the end of the exercise to call out where there are gaps.

### [2]Using the presentation
- Presentation slides: Use the presentation to work through the activity.
- Roles exercise: Keep the list of role ideas visible on a screen during the exercise to help kick-start the activity. It’s best not to use job titles.
- Tasks exercise: Keep the list of tasks visible on a screen during the exercise to help with thinking.
- Skills exercise: Articulate all the possible scenarios, for example, we need these skills in this content lifecycle stage. You can apply several skills for each lifecycle stage.
- Gaps task: Ask the participants to add red dots to any of the post-it notes to identify any gaps.
