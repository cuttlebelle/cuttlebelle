### [2]Uncoordinated approach
Lack of in-house or coordinated use of content skills. Little or no opportunity to understand user needs. Usually content is approved without a check for content quality. Relies on the individual’s awareness of content guides and standards. Relies on CMS publishers who are not empowered to improve content.

### [2]Not yet strategic — making a start
An unplanned and inconsistent approach to content lifecycle practices and checks for quality. A single manager coordinates individuals across wider teams. They promote quality through content communities of best practice, editorial guidelines and templates.

### [2]Strategically led
The agency agrees to content strategy goals. They encourage teams to focus on the content’s accuracy, relevancy and lifespan. They use endorsed guides and standards, check content and take part in communities of best practice. High-profile content is usability tested.

### [2]Maturing
Content strategy goals align with those of the agency. Content leaders empower team members with clear accountability and ownership. Teams rely on user research, content lifecycle workflow process, content communities and usability testing. Processes support the regular improvement or removal of content.

### [2]Mature
Agency leaders endorse the content strategy goals. They base high quality content on user needs analysis. Web analytics inform measures of success. Wider teams connect user and customer insights to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. Leaders help teams build capability.
