Whichever model you choose, you should aim for a consistent, quality user experience.

### [2]Decentralised content governance
Subject matter experts (SMEs) create and publish their own content.

#### [1]Pros:   
Faster approval and publishing times.

#### [1]Cons:
Managing content is localised, for example in business areas rather than agency-wide. There may be a tendency to prioritise business needs over user needs. It is often impossible to oversee quality standards (plain English, readability, accessibility). It is difficult to establish overall editorial and narrative consistency.

### [2]Centralised content governance
A central content team oversees content. In agencies these are often publishing teams who work on requests from SMEs.

#### [1]Pros:
A content strategy, supported by guidelines and templates, encourages capability building and the development of a content community. Quality reviews and checks are part of workflow to ensure continuous improvement.

#### [1]Cons:  
Often a complex workflow. There can also be delays in negotiating and finalising content.

### [2]Hybrid content governance
A hybrid content governance model works to improve content and efficiencies across extended teams. The central team’s focus is on high profile content meeting its strategic goals. They ensure the quality of published content. They own the site's information architecture.

Other lower profile content, such as a careers section, may be decentralised. These teams could create and edit their own content, but not be able to add new pages. Depending on resources and their content expertise, they may be able to publish their own pages.

#### [1]Pros:
Lines of accountability and ownership extend from leaders to doers and specialists. This gives structure to specialists in extended teams.

The subject matter expert informs and defines the ‘what’ and the ‘why’. The content expert knows about the ‘how’ and the ‘where’. This creates a strong workflow, using content types and quality checks.

#### [1]Cons:
Without strong governance and support from leaders, roles and responsibilities can become unclear and resources stretched. This model can be difficult to manage in that it needs a lot of maintenance, communication and coordination.
