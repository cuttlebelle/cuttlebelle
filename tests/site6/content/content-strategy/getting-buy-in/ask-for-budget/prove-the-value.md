It is useful to benchmark your current online services so that you can show the cost of poor content. Measurements can include:

- costs of transactions over the phone or in person
- online completion rates
- digital take-up
- user satisfaction

A benchmark will help you measure performance as you improve content. It will also help you show the return on investment from good content.


A content audit can help prove your case as it will show what you have and what needs to be done. You will have to [prove the value of a content audit](/content-strategy/content-auditing/prove-the-value/) first.

Try to give your stakeholders options, such as a sample content audit versus a full website content audit.
