Find out what senior leadership is excited about or look at their pain points and goals. For example, you could aim to fix a problem to meet a goal in the corporate plan.

It's helpful to offer memorable bite-sized statistics that show pain points, such as:
- 10% of our pages account for 74% of our traffic
- 50% of pages don't have an owner
- 65% of pages haven't been updated for 4 years

Always frame problems or pain points as opportunities for improvement. For example:
>by improving the readability of our website users will be more confident they have found the correct information, which will increase trust in our service.

Show how content improvement can help achieve organisation goals and support corporate values.
Selling the need will be more persuasive if you tell a story. Show your perfect future state and exactly how you plan to get there, including whatâ€™s standing in the way of reaching this goal.
