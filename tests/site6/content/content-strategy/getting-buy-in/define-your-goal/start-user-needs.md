Content is created for the people who use it. In your pitch show how the benefits to the end user create benefits for your organisation.

Show evidence from [user research](/user-research/) such as:
- quotes
- case studies
- videos of usability testing

This evidence will highlight the good and the bad aspects of your website. Telling [user stories](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/user-stories/) is a powerful way to make the case for content improvement.

Benchmarking current content before making proposed changes can help you argue how users can benefit from content improvements.

By thinking about your user you will be following Digital Service Standard criteria 1: [understand user needs](/digital-service-standard/1-understand-user-needs/).
