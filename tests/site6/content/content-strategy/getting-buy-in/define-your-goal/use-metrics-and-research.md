Find out if any research has already been done on your content within your organisation. This research should show the user needs and pain points your strategy is addressing. You can also do a [mini sample audit](/content-strategy/content-auditing/plan-your-audit) to discover any problems.

Show your pain points in numbers, for example:

- How many pages have little or no traffic?
- What is the percentage of out-of-date content on your website?
- What is the cost to the call centre for time spent on queries that could have been solved online with good content?
- Is there anything users are searching for on your site that should be there, but isn't? You can find this information through the 'nil search results' data.
- What is the percentage of duplicated content?
- What do analytics tell you about how your users navigate the site? What are the preferred pathways?

This may show neglected or duplicated pathways that you could argue a case to review and remove.
Use success stories of other websites either in your own agency or externally to show stakeholders the value of content improvement.

For example, by reducing 45% of pages on the Department of X website, the number of online transactions increased by 30% and reduced call centre contacts by 25%. This saved the agency $X.
