In order to work out the number of people you need, you should calculate the effort needed per page.

For example, for a content audit work out:
- the number of pages (or pieces of content)
- the time needed to analyse each piece of content
- how many days you have to complete the audit

This will tell you how many content auditors you need to meet your deadline.

You can also find content production calculators online.

Provide an overview of activities and costs. A timeline or roadmap is useful to show the duration of the project, milestones, constraints, dependencies and predicted deliverables.
