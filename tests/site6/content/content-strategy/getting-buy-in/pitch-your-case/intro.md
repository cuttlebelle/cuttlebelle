subtitle: Ideally, your pitch for content improvement should be structured around the goal to meet a user need (and in turn a business need).
category: Content strategy

Find out what works for your stakeholder and tailor your pitch to that. It could be a slide deck, an elevator pitch meeting or even a concise email.

Your pitch should be simple and include:
- the opportunity for change
- the need for change. For example, quotes from user research, case studies and statistics that support your case
- the need to follow broader government guidelines, such as the [Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/) and the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/)
- what you need from the decision makers. For example, time, money and people
- what the risks are
- what it will involve. For example, a roadmap of the activities, costs and delivery milestones
- what comes next: tell them the first thing you need. For example, approval for a content audit, hiring more people or even getting buy-in from another agency
