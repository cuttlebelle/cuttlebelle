If you are having trouble getting buy-in for content improvement you can:
- start small: if you have pitched a new website, reduce your scope and focus on smaller priorities that can be fixed now
- build support through those you already have onside 
- put standards like the Content Guide and the Digital Service Standard in place for all new content on the website
- keep stakeholders engaged and interested by telling them about website improvements, problems and opportunities
- show stakeholders a [user journey map](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/journey-mapping/) so they can empathise with your users and understand the pain points they experience when interacting with your service
