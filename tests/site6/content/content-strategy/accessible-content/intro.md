### [3]Accessibility and inclusivity facts

[Australian Bureau of Statistics 2015 survey for disability carers and ageing](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4430.0)

Almost 1 in 5 Australians live with disability. These figures do not include many people with

- learning, reading or other cognitive disabilities
- mental health issues
- colour vision deficiency
- temporary impairments or disabilities

Nor do they include many older people with age-related impairments.
