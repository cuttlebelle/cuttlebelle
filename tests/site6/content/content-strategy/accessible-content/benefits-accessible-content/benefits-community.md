By creating accessible content, you improve the experience of your service for all users. You also enable people to do what we ask of them. People who specifically benefit from accessible content include:

- people with disabilities
- people with low literacy
- older users
- mobile device users
- people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds
- remote and regional users
- international audiences

By complying with the 38 Level A and Level AA [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) criteria our information is accessible for more users. These users include those who:

- are blind or have a vision impairment 
- have colour vision deficiency 
- have motor difficulties with their hands or ams that make it hard to use a keyboard or mouse 
- have neurological conditions
- have cognitive or learning disabilities
- are deaf or have a hearing impairment

Even people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds or with low literacy can benefit.

You will also give all people more choice in how they access our content.
