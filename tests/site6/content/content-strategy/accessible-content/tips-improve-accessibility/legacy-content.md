Create an auditing plan with the aim of removing redundant PDFs, so you are left with a clear picture of the remaining scope.

Prioritise making popular or important PDFs accessible, or those you know will need to be updated in the near future. In the meantime, add a short message on the same web page as the legacy information with contact details so they can contact you if they are having trouble downloading or reading. Think about how you might make the information available to them.  

This kind of contact is good user feedback, so when they do contact you, add the PDF to your prioritised list to rework.
