Only make a PDF if there is a strong user need. PDFs are currently not fully accessible due to the current (2017) limitations of mobile screen readers such as [VoiceOver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidandyuk.voiceover&hl=en) and [TalkBack](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en&ref_topic=3529932). They often do not display properly on mobile devices. 

When we put the user first, we ask on their behalf if a PDF is really how they need to access the information. 

If there is a strong user need to have content available in non-HTML formats such as PDFs, content must be first published in HTML. The non-HTML format is published as secondary information. 

Consult the [GOV.AU Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/) to better understand accessibility and inclusivity.
