There will be scenarios where it is not practicable to convert the source information to HTML. For example:

- when a vendor has supplied content in an inaccessible format
- when it won't retain its functionality — for example spreadsheets with multiple worksheets and complex calculations 
- when you have evidence that your users only need it in the supplied format

Your report should still be published alongside an extract of the information in HTML. This could be in the form of an overview and/or findings or a table of contents.

Add a short message so your users can contact you. They may have trouble downloading, reading or otherwise accessing it. You will need to respond to any requests.
