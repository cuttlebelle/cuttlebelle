### [2]Disability Discrimination Act 1992

Private and public sector online complaints do happen.

The [Disability Discrimination Act 1992](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/disability-rights/about-disability-rights) protects Australians from discrimination. It is unlawful to treat people with disability any differently from those without disability. 

The Human Rights Commission's [World Wide Web Access: Disability Discrimination Act Advisory Notes](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/world-wide-web-access-disability-discrimination-act-advisory-notes-ver-41-2014) advises implementing WCAG 2.0 at level AA.

### [2]Commonwealth procurement rules

You need to consider the [Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs)](https://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/commonwealth-procurement-rules/). They require you to apply Australian standards (paragraphs 10.10 and 10.37). Standards Australia has adopted [AS EN 301-459](https://infostore.saiglobal.com/en-au/Standards/AS-EN-301-549-2016-1892396/).
