Redirects are a part of removal. They make sure:
- you give users options to continue their search for information
- your website keeps its search engine optimisation (SEO) integrity
- your website looks maintained

Talking to your ICT department is the usual process. Give them the list of your deleted URLs with the new URLs you’d like to redirect to. Add the date to go live, so the redirect process doesn’t happen before you remove content.
When redirecting, you should consider the user journey and SEO, pointing people to the information that’s the most relevant.
