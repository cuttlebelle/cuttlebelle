Look for ways to reduce duplicate content across Australian Government websites.

Some ways to reduce duplication:
- Talk to other agencies when you are developing or upgrading your IA.
- Research other websites both inside and outside government, which include information about similar subjects.
- Where there is a government agency which has similar content, try and meet with them or call them to discuss your project.  Aim to agree on how the websites will both relate to each other and avoid duplication.
- Develop a website working group within your larger department where you share user research, analytics information, knowledge and strategies.

If you are developing a large government website and there are smaller websites within your portfolio, include brief information about the sub-sites on your main website.  Then direct traffic across to those sites. Consider user needs in each instance when deciding on your linking strategy.

There are also some online tools which detect duplicate content across the web.
