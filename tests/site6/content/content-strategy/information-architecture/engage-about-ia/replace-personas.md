Personas are often used to describe typical users.

User profiles combined with actual stories from your interviews are better than personas.

It’s easier to feel empathy and get a deeper understanding of the user’s pain points through real user profiles.

This is a more authentic approach to finding out what your users need. It is better than grouping users into general types such as mothers working from home.
