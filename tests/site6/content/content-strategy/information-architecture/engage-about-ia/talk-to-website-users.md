Talk to the people who will use or currently use your website to find out:
- what tasks they might need to complete on the website
- their experience of using the existing website
- any pain points while using the existing website

Some ways you might engage with users include:
- face to face interviews
- online surveys, if you have an existing website
- phone interviews with users who have called the organisation
- guerilla research which involves approaching people who visit a customer service point within the department and asking them questions on the spot
- workshops

Your users should not need to understand your organisational chart to find information on your website.  Make sure you build your IA to meet user needs.

See [user research](/user-research/).
