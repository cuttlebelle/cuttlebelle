Consultation with internal stakeholders is key to a successful website project. 

For large websites impacting the whole organisation, consider conducting a roadshow throughout the organisation. Consult with  leaders and/or other key groups.

There may be a lot of staff across your organisation who contribute content to the website.  Make sure you consult with existing content owners about upcoming changes to the IA. Develop a list of owners/subject matter experts of new content.

If you don’t consult with the right people early in the process, you could put your work at risk.  Trying to make major changes late in the process is difficult.

Talk to other key groups during the early stages such as a call centre or customer service centre.  They often have good information about the problems callers have with your website.  They can also tell you the information people ask about the most.

Consult your legal team to identify mandatory items for your IA.
