You will also need to get buy-in from relevant content owners.

To have successful buy-in, you need to be prepared to talk about the benefits for the user and for the organisation.

This might include how your IA will:

make it easier for users to find information
reduce client enquiries by designing to meet user needs
align with the principles of Digital Service Standard (DSS)
meet accessibility requirements
improve search engine optimisation (SEO) so the website is easier to find online

Think about combining IA work with other activities such as content auditing (link) and content design.

Use supporting evidence such as user research to show why you want to do this work.
