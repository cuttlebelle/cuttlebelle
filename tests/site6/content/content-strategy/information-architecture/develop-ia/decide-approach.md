There are different ways you can group your information in your IA.  

### [2]Subject based
This involves grouping your information by the various subjects you need to cover. For example ‘Forestry, Fisheries, Biosecurity’.

### [2]Task based
This involves grouping your information by the task the user may want to achieve. For example ‘Participating in sport, Supporting sport, Research’.

### [2]Based on user types
This involves grouping your information by user types.  For example ‘Individuals, Business, Tax Professionals’. Consider using this approach for behavioural rather than demographic groupings.  For example ‘Buyers, Suppliers’ rather than demographic ‘Parents, Children, Adolescents’.  If you are considering demographic groupings test this out with users.  

Use IA design techniques like [card sorting](/content-strategy/information-architecture/ia-tools-techniques/#card-sorting) to help you find the best way to group your content.  In a card sorting session, ask participants to organise topics into categories that make sense to them. You can also ask them to help you label these groups.
