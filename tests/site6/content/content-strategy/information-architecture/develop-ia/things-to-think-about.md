### [2]Be consistent
Make sure there is a consistent approach to your labelling and structure.  This will help your users gain familiarity as they navigate through the site.

### [2]Use plain English
Make sure your headings and labelling are in plain English. Avoid ambiguity. Users should always have a good idea of what they are clicking on.

### [2]Accessibility
Your plan will need to include your approach to meeting criteria 9 of the Digital Service Standard.

This includes compliance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) which outlines ways to make digital content accessible.

Content authors are primarily responsible for meeting 17 WCAG 2.0 criteria of which several relate to heading structures and labelling.  See our [WCAG 2.0 guide for content authors](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/accessibility-inclusivity/#wcag-2-0-for-content-authors) for more information on making headings compliant.

### [2]Detailed IA
An option is to develop a model where you capture both the page titles in your IA and also the main content items within the page.  It would also include links to other content across the site.

### [2]Navigation
Your [site navigation](http://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide/patterns/navigation/index.html) will play an important role in helping your users get where they need to go. Think about how navigation elements and your IA will work together to make it easier for your users to find information.

### [2]Full menus vs partial menus
Menus in some instances can present too many calls to action which in turn can confuse a user. You may not need to make the full menu available at all times.  User research may show that once a user visits a section of your website, they may not visit another.  Rather than make a full menu always available, consider isolating content for a particular task and reducing menu items.

### [2]Consider Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
The way you structure your headings will have a big impact on your SEO.  You can also set your browser title to be a shortened version of your page title, to improve readability in search results.

See [Writing for SEO]().

### [2]Review search terms
The search terms users type into your onsite search may show you content gaps.

### [2}Avoid Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Avoid including pages of FAQs in your IA. FAQs date easily and suggest that web content is out of touch with the userâ€™s needs.

Only use FAQs in cases where there is genuinely a series of questions that are repeatedly asked.  Even in these cases think about whether you can include the information as part of your content pages.
