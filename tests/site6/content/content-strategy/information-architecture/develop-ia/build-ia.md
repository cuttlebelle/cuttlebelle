The process of developing your IA may start as early as the planning stage.  As you move into the engagement phase you will want to be capturing ideas and headings you might include in the IA.

There is no rule about when you should start.  However, make sure user needs are at the centre of the process.

When mapping out your main menu items you will want to limit these depending on the size of your website.  Best practice is no more than 7 items in the main menu however for larger sites you might need more.

You should judge this based on the needs of the content and the user. Don’t hide something in an unrelated section just to keep your number of top level sections low.

When it comes to the number of levels or depth for your IA, again limit the number unless you have a large site.  

Try and make your headings stand alone.  They should not rely on them being seen within the context of the whole IA.
