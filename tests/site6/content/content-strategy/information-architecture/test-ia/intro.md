subtitle: It is important to conduct usability testing as you develop your IA.

It can be worthwhile to involve some of the same people involved in the initial user research.

You don’t need to test the IA with a high number of people. Make sure you select a range of people from your target audiences. We recommend between 5-10 people.

It can be time consuming to bring in people from outside your organisation.  However, if they are key users it’s worth it. [Financial incentives](/user-research/paying-incentives) might be possible for non-government users.

The benefits of [usability testing](/digital-service-standard/10-test-the-service) include:
- increased confidence for your team prior to the build phase
- identification of any issues within the IA and the opportunity to fix them
- evidence base for proceeding with IA design, in case it is questioned later in the process

You can test your IA using software programs or a prototype of your site with a clickable IA.  This could even just be a spreadsheet with collapsed/expandable sections.

Identify the key areas of your IA design and labelling that you want to test. Create questions where you ask the user to complete a certain task on the website. Be careful not to include keywords from your IA in the testing questions as this will weight your results.  This is called scenario-based testing.

Example: You have to tell Centrelink that your weekly wage has changed. Find out what you need to do.

There is no set number of questions/tasks you should include in your testing.

Be mindful that most people will start to get tired  at around 45 minutes.  They will become familiar with your IA, so after a few questions you will be starting to test their memory of the structure more than how well your design is working.

Sit with the user while they’re completing the testing and ask them to talk about what they are doing. Make notes about how they try to locate information.

If you are working with a digital agency they might have a UX specialist who will conduct the testing.  If you can, sit in on the testing as it will give you valuable insights into user behaviour.
