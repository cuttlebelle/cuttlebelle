A/B testing is often used to test two versions of a web page to find out which performs better with users.

This method can also be used to test two versions of an IA or a heading within an IA.  It may be particularly helpful in resolving issues.  For example, if you have a label that your business would prefer and a label that your users would prefer, A/B testing will help you see which label your users will click on.
