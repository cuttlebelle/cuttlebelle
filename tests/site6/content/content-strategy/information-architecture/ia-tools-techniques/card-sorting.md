Card sorting involves creating cards which have the items that need to be included in your website/section then sorting them into categories and subcategories to form a proposed IA.

This process can be done digitally and non-digitally, for both new and existing websites.  It is usually conducted in one-on-one sessions.

Card sorting helps you to:
- visualise how items might be grouped within your IA
- understand how different groups and individuals would categorise items within an IA
- decide whether to make your IA [subject based, task based or based on user types](/content-strategy/information-architecture/develop-ia/#decide-approach)

Everyone thinks differently, so itâ€™s useful to conduct your card sort with a mixture of participants from your user groups.

If you have limited resources, card sorting with 1 person is better than not doing it at all.

Card sorting software allows you to create a URL for your card sorting activity that you can send to users remotely.

There are different types of card sorting activities.  In each instance, you will create the cards first but you or your users may add to them during the process.

### [2]Open
This involves users sorting the cards into categories they decide the cards best fit into.
There are no limits on the open card sort. New cards can be added at any level of the proposed structure.

### [2]Closed
This involves users sorting the cards into top level categories you have created.

### [2]Hybrid
This involves users sorting the cards into top level categories you have created but they can also create their own.

In a workshop setting, you might set a top-level structure but start by validating and refining that with the user group.
