A visual tool will help you to visualise your IA as it is being developed.  This is also useful to show stakeholders.  

There are commercial tools designed specifically for this purpose. Software used to develop organisational charts can also be useful.

Where IAs are deep and there are thousands of pages, use additional tools to map the complete IA.  The most available option is to map your full IA using a spreadsheet.

Set up version control practices early as your IA will change repeatedly.
