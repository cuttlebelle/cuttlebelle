A content audit is an exercise where everyone works together for the common goal of improving content to better meet user needs.

Due to the work involved in developing good content it’s natural for people to sometimes feel a personal attachment to content they have published. After all, a lot of time and energy goes into writing specialist or technical content.

It can also be a time consuming task getting the content reviewed and approved for publishing on a website. As a result, it can be difficult for some people to let content go – be it decommissioned, rewritten or merged in with other similar content on the website.

Be sure to remember and empathise with this if you’re working with line areas to conduct a content audit. By making people feel involved, and acknowledging the expertise that each group brings, it's easier to work towards the common goal of improving the user's experience. 

## [1]Tips for successful working relationships

- Define and discuss roles and responsibilities with the teams involved in the content audit so that everyone understands how they can best contribute.
- Listen to and document any concerns and needs that get raised.
- Communicate often. Set up regular catch-up meetings to discuss progress. This is also a good way for the wider team to get to know your main stakeholders. 
- Work with stakeholders on the main aspects of the audit, including setting up any technical work and the process you’ll use when auditing the content. You may be able to share skills and knowledge with each other to make things easier and more efficient.
