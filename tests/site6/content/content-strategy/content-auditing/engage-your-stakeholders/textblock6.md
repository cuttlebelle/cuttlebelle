It’s hard to audit content that’s changing.

Putting in place a content freeze might help you manage the workload. A content freeze restricts the amount of new content published or content changes that can be made on the website during a content audit. 

You will need to negotiate the scope of the freeze and timeframes with executives and content owners. Also, be aware of any upcoming publishing needs that must be factored in during your audit such as ministerial announcements and legislative changes. 

An alternative approach might be to decide on your active content and inactive pages and decide on a content audit method and timing for the two.
