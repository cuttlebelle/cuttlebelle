Content audits don’t just make things easier for the end user. They also help people working across the organisation. 

A content audit can create efficiencies that:

- make it easier for website managers, administrators and content owners to manage content with clear evidence – leading to less quantity but more quality
- can help website owners develop a content strategy to set the future direction for more improvements
