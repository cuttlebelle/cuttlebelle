To develop a clear picture of the users, consolidate your research and data. Read or [analyse](/user-research/analysing-user-research/) the research you have collected. Decide the following:

### [2]User segments and needs

Find out who is using your product and service, and if there are clear groups of users with different needs.

### [2]Common interactions

Find out the [user journey and user experience](/service-design-delivery-process/whole-user-experience/) of your service, for example:
- Why did they need to use the service?
- What did they plan to do?
- What did they do?
- Were they satisfied with the service?

### [2]Gaps in the research

Decide on research or further exploration that still needs to be done.
