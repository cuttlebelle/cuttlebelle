section: When should you use existing research?
---
When creating content, consider all the possible users of your product or service. Existing research and data can help you find out about your users and their needs.

Existing research and data is a good starting point, but it shouldn’t be relied on as comprehensive. Sometimes sources may be limited or dated. Existing research and data may not address your specific context or problems. It also won’t help the team to develop a deep understanding of, and empathy for, users and their needs.

Existing research and data shouldn’t replace your own user research. User research is the best way to learn about users and create services that meet their needs.
