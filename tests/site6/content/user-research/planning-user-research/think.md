At the beginning of each stage of the service design and delivery process, work as a team to:

- write your research questions (or ‘unknowns’) and group them by theme
- agree on the groups of users you want to research
- decide how to recruit participants for each activity
- review and share the findings of any existing research
- find any challenges or deadlines that may influence your research plan
- decide what user research activities will help you answer your questions — the [18F Method Cards](https://methods.18f.gov/) are quick guides to activities

You will need a wall on which you can attach sticky notes. Use this space to share information about your research goals and findings.
