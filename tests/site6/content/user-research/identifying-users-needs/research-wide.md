For government services, it’s best to start wide and then narrow down your user research.


Begin by looking at as many different users of your service as possible. That way you’ll see the entire spectrum of users, from the mainstream to the edges. You should cover them all in the [Discovery stage](../research-stages/#user-research-in-discovery-stage).

The mainstream users will show you what business as usual is for your service. You’ll see why they are using products and how they are managing the processes.

At the extremes, you'll see the groups of people who may be finding it difficult to access your service. You’ll find out their current pain points. These might include things that are pushing them out of your service. For example, they may find the service too difficult to navigate.

Other users might have workarounds for accessing your service. For example, they might use websites to translate content into their preferred language.

Build the service so that it works for the people with the most barriers to accessing it. That way, you can be sure you’re building it for everyone.

### [2]Define your participant criteria

First, define all the different groups of people you need to include in your research by using information from:
- existing research
- subject experts
- frontline staff
- service data 
- analytics
- general population statistics
- user groups that may have different experiences when using your product
- user personas (if available)

When you've defined your overall criteria, decide which groups you will include in each round of research.
