Interviews usually take place with 1 user at a time. But you can also speak to people in pairs or small groups if they use a service together. For example, you might interview:

- family members who help each other
- members of a team who work together

### [2]Work out how much detail you need
Interviews can take between 30 minutes and 2 hours. The length of time depends on the complexity of the subject and the number of questions you have.

Longer interviews will give you more detail. But they may make it harder to recruit participants.

### [2]Choose a location for your research

Interviews can take place almost anywhere, for example:

- a user’s home or workplace
- over the phone
- a research studio
- a café
- a public library

Make sure the participants can access the location.

### [2] Recruit research participants

There are different ways to [find people to participate in user research](/user-research/find-user-research-participants/). These people should be current or likely users of the service you’re researching.

Plan for any [incentives you’ll pay to the participants](/user-research/paying-incentives/).

Arrange interpreters or assistants for participants who need them.

### [2]Prepare consent forms
Make sure you have [informed consent from the participants](/user-research/consent-forms/) before you interview them.

Think about whether you need to record the session. If you do, make sure the consent forms cover this.

### [2]Prepare for a note taker and observers
[Arrange a note taker and consider whether to invite observers](/user-research/interviewing-users/#taking-notes-and-observing) for each session.

Observers are important for certain kinds of research, like lab-based usability testing. But think about how their presence may affect the participants. Sometimes you should not invite observers (aside from the note taker) into the room.
