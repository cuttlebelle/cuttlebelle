There are rules around [how the government can use personal information](https://www.oaic.gov.au/individuals/privacy-fact-sheets/general/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles). You need to make sure the information you collect is secure from misuse or unauthorised access.

Some users may need their information to be treated differently (for example, if the user has a disability or if they have children present during a recording). Factor this into your [user research plan](/user-research/planning-user-research/).
