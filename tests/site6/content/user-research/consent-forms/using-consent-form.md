You should start [interviews with users](/user-research/interviewing-users) by explaining the purpose of the research. Show participants the consent form.

Explain that they have a choice about what they wish to consent to. Get permission before starting any form of recording (audio, visual or written).

Sometimes a participant may say something that they donâ€™t feel comfortable sharing. After the interview, make sure they still consent to you using the information.

The DTA has a blog about [how to ensure informed consent in user research.](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/informed-consent-in-user-research/)

Leave a copy of the consent form with the participant at the end of the session. This gives them a record of what they have agreed to. It also lets them know how they can withdraw consent if they want to later.

A good way to do this is to take a digital copy of the form and leave the original with the participant.
