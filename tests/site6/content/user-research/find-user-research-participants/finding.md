There are different ways to recruit participants:
- use a research recruitment agency
- work with a professional body, specialist charity or community group
- work with specialist sections of other agencies (for example, Multicultural Services in the Department of Human Services)
- create a panel of potential participants (for regular research with a specific group of people)
- invite existing users of your service to take part

It's generally best to use a research recruitment agency for recruiting end users. Recruiting participants is a lot of work and agencies tend to be able to do it at a reasonable rate. This can be good value for money.

But you may also need to try different ways of finding specific users. Relevant professional bodies, charities or community groups might be more effective.

Think about and budget for [paying incentives](/user-research/paying-incentives/) to research participants. Research recruitment agencies can handle incentive payments.
