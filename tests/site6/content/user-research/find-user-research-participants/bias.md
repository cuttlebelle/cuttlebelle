There is a risk that groups of people can be included or excluded, depending on:
- what the activity is
- when you schedule the sessions
- where you do the research
- the method you use to recruit your users

Limit this risk by using a variety of research activities and recruitment approaches. For example, don't just rely on interviews in Discovery stage. Do some contextual research with users of existing services.

If youâ€™re using an agency make sure they include a range of participants. For example:
- people with different levels of digital and literacy skill
- people from different cultural backgrounds
- people who have different work patterns (part time, full time, casual workers)
