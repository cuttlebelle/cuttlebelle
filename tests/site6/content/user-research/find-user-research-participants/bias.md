There is a risk that groups of people can be included or excluded, depending on:
- what the activity is
- when you schedule the sessions 
- where you do the research
- the method you use to recruit your users

Limit this risk by using a variety of research activities and recruitment approaches. For example, don't just rely on interviews in Discovery stage. Do some contextual research with users of existing services.

If you’re using an agency make sure they include a range of participants. For example:
- people with different levels of digital and literacy skill
- people from different cultural backgrounds
- people who have different work patterns (part time, full time, casual workers)
