If you’ve worked out that it is appropriate to pay an incentive, decide on the type of incentive you will offer.

### [2]Paying incentives through research recruitment agencies

When you use an agency to recruit participants, the incentive is typically cash or a voucher. The value will depend on the cohort that you are trying to reach and the length of the research session. You can ask agencies for advice on how much you should give.

If you’re using a recruitment agency, avoid handling cash incentives yourself. The agency can send the incentive to the participants once the research is complete.

You can ask the recruitment agency to hire a venue that has a host who can manage your participants and hand over the cash incentive on your behalf. For example, if your target group is seniors, they may feel more comfortable with a senior host. There is usually an additional cost for this, which you should factor into your research budget.

You can find agencies that recruit research participants on the [Digital Marketplace](https://marketplace.service.gov.au/).

### [2]Paying incentives to participants

If you don’t use a recruitment agency, you can still pay incentives to participants.

Check your agency’s policy on paying people for research participation.

Make sure that the incentive is appropriate to the participant’s background and personal circumstances. For example, offer a voucher or gift card for a store that the participant can travel to easily.

Keep a record of which incentive you gave to which participant. You can manage this if you use gift cards by recording the card number and having the participant sign for it.
