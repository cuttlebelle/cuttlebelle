Paying incentives for participation in user research is common practice both commercially and in governments around the world.

Incentives are rewards that can motivate people to take part in research. They are different to reimbursements for costs such as travel expenses.

Check if your agency has a policy around paying incentives for user research.The Australian Government National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research may help guide your decision.

It’s usual to pay incentives to people who take part in usability testing. But there are some other types of research where incentives might not be appropriate. For example, payment may:
- represent a conflict of interest
- become a form of indirect coercion (where the participants are vulnerable or disadvantaged)

You have a responsibility for participants both during and after your research session.

Think about these questions to help you decide about paying incentives:

- What is the participant’s relationship to your organisation? Is there a power relationship? Is the participant a supplier or public servant?
- Would an incentive influence the results?
- Would the participant get involved without the incentive?
- Does the incentive take account of the participant’s socioeconomic situation? Could it be seen as coercion if they are from a disadvantaged or vulnerable background?
- Is the incentive appropriate to the participant’s cultural background?
