subtitle: Alpha is an experimental stage. It’s an opportunity to use prototypes to work out the right thing to build.

In Alpha stage you test the hypotheses that you reached at the end of Discovery stage. As you progress through Alpha, you will produce new hypotheses as you discover new things about the users and service.

You’re not validating what users like or dislike. You are finding out how well prototypes meet the actual needs of users.
