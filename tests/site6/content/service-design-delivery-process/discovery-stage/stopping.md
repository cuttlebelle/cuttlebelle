Your findings may show it’s best to stop at Discovery, for example, if you discover:
- there’s no user need for what you’ve been exploring
- user needs are already being met by another service
- technology or policy constraints mean you won’t be able to build a service in the timeframe

It’s not a failure to stop developing a service after Discovery if your findings show that’s the best thing to do. The Discovery will still be successful because you will understand the problem better and the team can move on to something else that will add more value.
