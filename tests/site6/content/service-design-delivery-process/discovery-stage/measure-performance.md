In Discovery you should start thinking about how you will measure and report on your service’s performance.

To meet [Criteria 11 of the Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/11-measure-performance/) you must report on 4 key performance indicators (KPIs):
- user satisfaction
- digital take-up
- completion rate
- cost per transaction

Talk to the Performance Dashboard team to help you understand what you need to meet Criteria 11 of the Digital Service Standard: performance-dashboard@digital.gov.au

Complete the following work so that you have the right framework for the later stages:
- map the user journey and work out the pain points
- start to understand what a transaction looks like for your service
- find out what analytics tools your organisation already has and whether they’re suitable for the type and volume of data you’re expecting
- work out what metrics are currently available and record baselines
- find out where existing data for the service is kept and how you’re going to access it
- start thinking about additional data you might need that doesn’t currently exist or isn’t easily accessible
