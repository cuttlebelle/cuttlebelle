Start Discovery with a kick-off session that includes:
- the whole team
- subject matter experts
- business owners
- senior stakeholders

The kick-off should include:
- a team-building exercise
- definition of roles
- sharing what you already know about the problem (including existing research and data about the service and the current user experience)
- creating a vision statement of what you will do — you will continue to develop this in the later stages
- a definition of what success will look like at the end of Discovery (the things you want to find out and the artefacts you need to produce)
- timeframe, milestones and when you will be reporting back to stakeholders

During the kick-off the team should agree:
- principles, values and ground rules (this may become your team’s social contract)
- operating rhythm, including how long sprints will be and when you will hold team rituals (stand ups, planning, showcases and retrospectives)
- channels you will use to communicate
- how you will keep track of the tasks you’re working on (for example, kanban wall)
- where you will work
- who will be working on what
