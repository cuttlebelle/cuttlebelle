Before you start the Discovery stage, make sure you:
- have the right [roles in the team](/starting-team/roles/) and understand how a [multidisciplinary team](/starting-team/multidisciplinary-team/) works
- understand user-centred design and why we need to [own the whole user experience](/service-design-delivery-process/whole-user-experience/)
- understand agile delivery and how you will do budgeting and reporting when using agile
- find stakeholders and subject matter experts
- have all relevant reviews and approvals in place for your proposed research, have started your user research plan and are ready to start researching straight away
- have an open space for the team to co-locate with internet access, IT systems and printers
- have purchased any equipment needed by the team (for example, laptops)

You need to do all of these things before you can start Discovery. If you don’t have everything ready to go, the team may be blocked for a long time. For example, ethical reviews and approvals on a user research plan might take several sprints of the team’s time.
