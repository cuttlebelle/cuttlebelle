The Discovery stage is when the service design and delivery process starts.

The purpose of Discovery is to get a deep understanding of the problems users are trying to solve. It helps the team challenge their existing ideas of what the problem and solution might be.

This stage is for discovering, not validating. You won’t start prototyping and testing service design until the [Alpha stage](../alpha-stage/).
