You will create several artefacts and keep adding to them as you go through Discovery. The team will keep building and validating these artefacts — especially the user journey map — as it goes through the later stages.

An [empathy wall](/user-research/research-stages/#empathy-wall) helps the team understand how real users get things done and their experience with current service and products.

An [insight wall](/user-research/analysing-user-research/#user-research-insights) shows people’s pain points using quotes that reflect their problems with current products and services, and what they are trying to do.
