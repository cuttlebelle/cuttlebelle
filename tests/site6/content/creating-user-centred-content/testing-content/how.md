It is best to test content with a [user researcher](/starting-team/roles/) and the support of a multidisciplinary team. If you’re working alone, there are still some simple techniques you can try.

If you’re thinking of doing content testing yourself, you can start small by doing simple checks. You can do these quickly, without significant budget and resources.

Testing content requires a deep understanding of [user research](/user-research/). Test content with real users of your service to get meaningful insights about user needs.

If you’re unsure what to test your content for, find user needs based on previous contact with users. For example:

- [existing research or feedback](/user-research/planning-user-research/using-existing-research-data/) collected by your organisation
- findings from your [Discovery stage](/user-research/research-stages/#user-research-in-discovery-stage)

Focus on known user needs when testing your content. For example, previous user feedback may suggest your content is confusing. Try focusing your content testing on readability and comprehension.

Note that existing research and Discovery findings can complement your own research. It shouldn’t be relied on as comprehensive. Sometimes sources may be limited or dated.

[Analyse](/user-research/analysing-user-research/) and apply insights from each test to improve your content, which you can then test again.
