Good content design begins with user research. This is then translated into simple and clear content that meets a user need. As a content designer you need to:
- think about your problem first
- find a purpose for your content
- define your scope
- create your content around user needs
- balance business priorities with user needs
- present information for your users at the right touch points when they need it

### [2]Start with your users

A good content designer always asks what the user need is and how to meet this need. Be careful not to exclude user groups or assume what services users might need. Always think about [inclusivity and diversity](/user-research/identifying-users-needs/#make-your-research-inclusive).

To create user-centred content you need to [research with your users](/user-research/), which includes [using existing research](/user-research/planning-user-research/using-existing-research-data/).

Analysing your research will help you [identify users and their needs](/user-research/identifying-users-needs).

### [2]Design content around user needs

You need to decide on the [type of content](http://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/types-of-content/) to meet your need. Content could include text, video, audio, a tool and so on.

Think about the best format for your user as this will affect how they access your service or get the information they need.

As part of your content design you might decide that you need to:
- create new content
- reduce content
- break up content into separate pages or topics
- change the format
- [remove content](/content-strategy/removing-content)

Content design works best in an Agile environment with a [multidisciplinary team](/starting-team/multidisciplinary-team). When creating new services or improving existing content you should follow the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process) of Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live. This helps you to continually test and improve your content.

### [2]Write content that’s easy to understand

Design your content using the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/) for guidance on voice and tone, writing style, plain English, format, accessibility and inclusivity.

To design high-quality content follow the [Digital Transformation Agency’s design principles](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-principles/).

### [2]Continually work to make your content better

Putting content in front of users for testing helps you understand what’s working well and what’s not. Ideally this should be done before content goes live. Continue monitoring content once it’s published.

Test your content with real users, capture feedback and test again. User needs can change, so keep updating.
