### [2]In Discovery and Alpha stages
During the [Discovery stage](/service-design-delivery-process/discovery-stage/) and [Alpha stage](/service-design-delivery-process/alpha-stage/) the entire team should have spent a lot of time with end users and learned a lot about their needs. You should understand and be able to show evidence to demonstrate the following.

#### [1]Who are the users?

What about the users' motivations, triggers, contexts are significant for your service?

How can you find the users to invite them to participate in user research? You must include users with varying needs (such as needs arising from disability, cultural diversity, literacy and remoteness).

Consider all the users in the service including end users, users in government who are delivering the service, and key intermediaries (professional and personal network).

#### [1]What is the real task(s) that people are trying to achieve when they encounter your service?

What is the ‘job’ people are trying to get done that your service is a part of? You need to describe this in words that real end users would use, not using government terminology.

#### [1]How are users currently doing the task your service aims to help them do?

Think about all key touch points, for example through journey maps.

What other relevant government and non-government services are also in use at this time?

Where are the pain points in the current experience?

#### [1]What are the user needs?

What are the opportunities to remove or reduce the pain points? How might we better meet the user needs? Demonstrate this through research, testing and validating possible solutions with prototypes.

#### [1]Are you designing the right thing?

How have your insights from user research helped you to define your minimum viable product (MVP)?

How does the MVP create value for users and government by better meeting user needs?

### [2]In Beta stage
During the [Beta stage](/service-design-delivery-process/beta-stage/) your understanding of what your users value will have matured through testing design prototypes with them.

By the end of the Beta stage you should be able to show greater depth and diversity of knowledge on all of the points above from Alpha and Beta. You should also as be able to show the following.

#### [1]How has your service been shaped by user needs?

Show how you have made changes in the service and interaction design in response to user research and usability testing.

You can evidence this by showing how the design has changed over time and the appropriate research findings that have driven this change.

#### [1]How have you tested the system in the users’ context with a full range of users (including users with varying needs)?

You can evidence this with artefacts of research, for example, video clips and outcomes from research analysis.

#### [1]Are you prepared for ongoing user research?

Show how you plan to continue to test the system with users and the resources for this, for example through an ongoing research plan and budget.

#### [1]What have you not solved yet?

What the significant design challenges are, for example through key insights, how have you approached them? How do you plan to continue to tackle them?

#### [1]How will you know if your design is working?

Make sure that research has fed into the [metrics you have developed](../11-measure-performance/) to know that you continue to meet your user needs.

By the time you are ready to [go live](/service-design-delivery-process/live-stage/) you should be able to show greater depth of knowledge for all the points above. You should also:
-  show how you are using data from real users to understand which parts of the task users are finding difficult, and how you are designing experiments to reduce friction and increase success for users
-  know how you will [measure and monitor your service](../11-measure-performance/) to ensure it is serving its users well
