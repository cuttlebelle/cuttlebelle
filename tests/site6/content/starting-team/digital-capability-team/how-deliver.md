Often teams will have people of different levels of experience, but their individual experience is not a clear measure of the team’s digital capability.

A team of people who have low levels of experience may have high digital capability because they are:

- passionate about meeting user needs
- led by a very experienced product manager
- open to collaborating
- keen to work as a [multidisciplinary team](../multidisciplinary-team/)
- innovative
- not afraid to take risks

A team of experienced people may have low digital capability because they:

- don’t work well with each other
- don’t focus on meeting user needs
- work in silos
- do things the way things have always been done
- are risk averse
